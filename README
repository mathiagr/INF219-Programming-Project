This was a project from fall 2017 in INF219 - Project in Programming I

The project was to use scrapy to scrape appartments for sale in Bergen listed on www.finn.no, then use machine learning on
the data to be able to predict real estate prices on new listings.
The ML algorithms I used in Python was first a ID3 Decision Tree and the Random Forrest
algorithm in the Keras library. Based on only 400 appartments as training data and 35 for testing
I was able to predict prices with an error of about 10%.
