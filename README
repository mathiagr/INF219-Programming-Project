This was a project from fall 2017 in INF219 - Project in Programming I

The (self chosen) project was to use Scrapy to scrape appartments for sale in Bergen listed on www.finn.no 
(throughout fall of 2017),
then use machine learning on the data to be able to predict real estate prices on new listings.

The ML algorithms I used in Python was first an ID3 Decision Tree (modified version used in the INF283 course at UiB) 
and the Random Forrest from the the Keras library. 
Based on only 400 appartments as training data and 35 for testing I was able to predict prices with an error of about 10%.
